Starting a game of Pentago:

    - Run "main.py"
    - Enter your players info on one line separated by a space.
    - i.e. "name", "color", and "type of player"

    Example:
    >  Carl W Human

    - Player one is selected randomly to go first.
    
Game Play:
    - Entering moves:
      Enter moves using the following format
      "Block Number"/"Block index" "block""Rotation direction"

        i.e. 2/1 2R
        This would place a marble on the second block and in the first of 9 positions on the block.

        - Directions of rotation are 'r', 'R', 'l', or 'L' for right and left rortatation
